## Climp Up!

Climp up! is my final project, which I created for the Unity Learning path. The player lands on a deserted island and has to get to the top of the highest mountain.
To do this, he has a gravity gun with which he can place stone platforms in certain places to get higher.

I developed this application for the Oculust Quest 2. The gravity gun can be used with the right or left hand.
